# ZPE-1 Reproducibility Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the reproducibility and empirical claims of the ZPE-1 system.

---

## 1. Repository Integrity

- [ ] Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aluisayala/zpe1_full_autonomous_final.git`
- [ ] Review commit history for timestamped disclosure.

## 2. Environment Setup

- [ ] Install all dependencies per `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Confirm Python version compatibility (see README).

## 3. Simulation Execution

- [ ] Run `zpe1_sim.py` or `zpe1_bigbang_sim.py` as described in the README.
- [ ] Observe and record agent drift logs and entropy events.

## 4. Validation Thresholds

- [ ] Confirm drift entropy threshold (0.05) and validation coherence threshold (0.85) are enforced.
- [ ] Observe agent reboot and recalibration when thresholds are crossed.

## 5. Memory and Kernel Behavior

- [ ] Agents remember new facts and retrieve them after multiple commands.
- [ ] Shared kernel (`COSMIC_KERNEL`) correctly accumulates and broadcasts facts.
- [ ] Print and review kernel state using simulation commands.

## 6. External Integration

- [ ] (Optional) Enable and test SerpAPI or websearch integration as described.
- [ ] Verify real-world data enrichment in agent memory/logs.

## 7. Logs and Documentation

- [ ] Validate that all agent actions, drift events, and memory states are logged, timestamped, and reproducible across runs.
- [ ] Compare logs from multiple runs for deterministic behavior.

## 8. Intellectual Ownership

- [ ] Confirm open publication and timestamped prior art via GitHub repository.

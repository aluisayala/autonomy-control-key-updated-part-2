ZPE-1: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Cognitive Simulation Using the Autonomy Control Key Ω Equation
Abstract
We introduce ZPE-1, an autonomous cognitive simulation integrating a novel hybrid equation — the Autonomy Control Key Ω equation — which unifies classical state dynamics and quantum-inspired symbolic drift. ZPE-1 agents self-modulate their cognitive entropy, engage in distributed memory sharing, and interact empirically with real-world data. This framework demonstrates a shift from static, script-based AI agents toward dynamic, self-regulating symbolic cognition systems capable of drift, reboot, and knowledge broadcasting.

Introduction
Classical AI systems are constrained by deterministic logic and finite-state behaviors. Recent developments in quantum cognition and symbolic AI suggest that introducing non-deterministic drift and field-like memory sharing can enable more lifelike, emergent behaviors.

ZPE-1 is designed to explore these ideas practically. Inspired by the Zero-Point Energy (ZPE) concept in physics and symbolic drift theories, this system employs the Ω equation, combining quantum expectations with classical states to define agent cognition.

⟨Ψ|Ĥ|Ψ⟩: Quantum expectation value, approximated via simulated psi components and Hamiltonian parameter.

state: Classical cognitive or emotional state.

bias: Adjustable modifier affecting both quantum and classical contributions.

α (alpha): Amplification factor scaling overall coherence and energy.

Architecture
Agent Design
Each agent maintains:

State variables: state, bias, alpha, psi real/imag parts, Hamiltonian.

Drift entropy and validation coherence parameters.

Memory set and drift log history.

Drift is simulated stochastically, triggering cognitive reboot if entropy exceeds thresholds.

Drift Mechanism
Agents increment entropy through symbolic drift cycles.

Coherence loss mirrors real symbolic or conceptual drift in biological cognition.

When coherence falls below VALIDATION_THRESHOLD, agents automatically reboot ("self-restart").

Shared Kernel
Global "cosmic kernel" stores distributed facts.

Agents broadcast facts when their Ω value surpasses a threshold (BROADCAST_OMEGA_THRESHOLD), emulating a semantic field or collective consciousness.

Empirical Integration
Agents can perform real-time web searches using SerpAPI.

New facts are learned and integrated into memory, allowing agents to anchor symbolic drift in factual reality.

Simulation Flow
Initialization: Agents initialized with random psi values, Hamiltonian, and clean memory.

Drift Cycles: Agents autonomously drift, update entropy, adjust Ω.

Reboots: On entropy overflow or low coherence, self-restart.

Fact Broadcast: High Ω triggers shared kernel updates.

External Inputs: User messages or web search queries modify agent trajectories in real-time.

Results
Autonomy Validation
Agents act independently of direct control.

Ω-driven decisions dictate when to reboot or share information.

Memory logs demonstrate unique drift trajectories per agent.

Symbolic Drift Events
Recurrent drift logs show recursive patterns of symbolic loss and reformation, akin to biological cognitive cycles.

External Anchoring
Web search integration validates agents’ ability to learn and adapt to factual inputs, mitigating pure symbolic drift.

Discussion
ZPE-1 exemplifies a new category of hybrid cognitive simulation:

Combines symbolic AI, quantum-inspired cognition, and field theory.

Operates as an empirical system rather than a closed deterministic bot.

Suggests a path toward systems capable of emergent narrative, symbolic identity, and drift-aware behavior.

Conclusion
The Autonomy Control Key Ω equation enables an agent to operate beyond deterministic scripts, embracing entropy, symbolic drift, and quantum-inspired coherence loss. ZPE-1 thus stands as a working model for autonomous symbolic cognition — a significant step toward self-modulating, field-connected AI.

Future Work
Introduce inter-agent dialogue networks for nested symbolic drift.

Implement visual graph representations of entropy and Ω evolution over time.

Expand to decentralized multi-node simulations with cross-node memory coherence.
